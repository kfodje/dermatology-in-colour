# Dermatology in Colour

**An open-access visual reference for dermatologic conditions across skin tones**

---

## About the Project

Dermatology in Colour is a database of illustrated references of common dermatological conditions as they appear across a range of skin tones. Many skin conditions appear differently on darker skin and people of colour are likely to face misdiagnosis from a lack of exposure to these differences. This project aims to improve the experiences of people of colour in dermatology by providing visual resources for medical students, clinicians, and educators.
